Data Scientist,SQL,Q1,"You have a table EmployeeSales(emp_id, sale_date, amount) where each employee can have multiple sales per day. Write a query to find the top 2 employees with the highest total sales in each month. Explain how GROUP BY, window functions, and ranking work together in your solution. What changes if two employees have the same total sales?",typed,"First, GROUP BY is used to calculate the total sales of each employee for every month by summing the sales amount. After aggregation, window functions are applied to rank employees within each month based on their total sales. Ranking functions help compare employees only within the same month without collapsing the result set. Based on this ranking, the top two employees per month are selected. If two or more employees have the same total sales, they receive the same rank, which may result in more than two employees being returned for that month depending on the ranking method used."
Data Scientist,Python / Data Handling,Q2,"While working with a large dataset in Pandas, you notice that operations like filtering and groupby are becoming slow. What are the main reasons for this performance issue? How would you optimize the workflow using Pandas, NumPy, or alternative tools? When would you prefer using Dask or Spark instead of Pandas? ",typed,TO_BE_ADDED
Data Scientist,System Design Basics,Q3,Design a simple data pipeline for collecting user activity data from a website and preparing it for analysis. What components would you include from data collection to storage? Where would basic data cleaning happen? Keep the design simple and explain it at a high level. ,typed,TO_BE_ADDED
Data Scientist,Operating Systems,Q4,"Explain how multitasking works in an operating system. What is the difference between a process and a thread? Why are threads often preferred in data-intensive applications? What role does context switching play, and how does it affect performance?",typed,TO_BE_ADDED
Data Scientist,Machine Learning,Q5,"You trained a regression model that performs very well on training data but poorly on validation data. What does this indicate about the model? Explain at least three different ways to address this issue, and when each method is appropriate. How would you verify that the problem is actually resolved?",voice,"If a model performs very well on training data but poorly on validation data, it usually indicates overfitting, meaning the model has learned patterns specific to the training data rather than general trends. One way to address this is by simplifying the model when it is too complex. Another common approach is regularization, which adds a penalty to large weights and helps reduce overfitting. Using more training data or data augmentation can also help the model generalize better. To verify that the issue is resolved, we check whether validation performance improves and whether the gap between training and validation results decreases."
Data Scientist,Python / Data Handling,Q6,"In a machine learning pipeline, you often need to remove duplicate records while preserving the original order of the data. Which data structure would you choose to achieve this efficiently? How would the solution differ if memory usage is a major constraint? Explain the time complexity in both cases. ",voice,TO_BE_ADDED
Data Scientist,Python / Data Handling,Q7,"You are given a very large dataset that arrives as a continuous stream (for example, real-time sensor or user-click data). You need to frequently find the median value at any point in time, while also supporting fast insertion of new elements. Which data structures would you use to solve this efficiently? Why is a single sorted array or linked list not suitable here? Explain the time and space complexity trade-offs of your chosen approach.",voice,TO_BE_ADDED
